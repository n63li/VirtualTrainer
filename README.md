# Virtual Trainer

## Introduction
Welcome to the iOS app for our virtual trainer FYDP project. 

## Getting Started
### Amplify
Follow the following Amplify [link](https://sandbox.amplifyapp.com/test/fc466f4e-40ce-4cf8-b139-24bb7b5c9882). 
In order to pull down the latest Amplify models, you must first download the Amplify CLI with the following code:
```
curl -sL https://aws-amplify.github.io/amplify-cli/install | bash && $SHELL
```
Next, run the following command from your project's root folder:
```
amplify pull --sandboxId fc466f4e-40ce-4cf8-b139-24bb7b5c9882
```
Amplify dependencies are installed through CocoaPods. Open a terminal window and navigate to the location of the Xcode project for your app.
1. Initialize CocoaPods: 
    ```
    pod init
    ```
2. Install the Amplify pod into your project:
    ```
    pod install --repo-update
    ```
3. Follow these instructions in this StackOverflow [article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65261123/xcode-project-fails-to-find-the-amplifymodels-file-that-is-generated-for-ios-p) to add the Amplify files into your Xcode workspace.
